===================================================================================
| *Research Goal* 
LenMa was the final log parser that was evaluated as part of SP-1. The purpose of 
this subproject is to understand the log transformation process (parsing raw logs). 
This is part of the broader goal to empirically test existing anomaly detection 
models.
